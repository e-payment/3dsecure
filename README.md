3-D Secure
===========
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

[3-D Secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure) is an XML-based protocol designed to be an additional security layer for online credit and debit card transactions. It was originally developed by `Arcot Systems, Inc` and first deployed by `Visa` with the intention of improving the security of Internet payments and is offered to customers under the name `Verified by Visa`. Services based on the protocol have also been adopted by `MasterCard` as `MasterCard SecureCode`, and by `JCB` International as `J/Secure`. `American Express` added 3-D Secure on November 8, 2010, as `American Express SafeKey`, in select markets and continues to launch additional markets. Analysis of the protocol by academia has shown it to have many security issues that affect the consumer, including greater surface area for phishing and a shift of liability in the case of fraudulent payments.
